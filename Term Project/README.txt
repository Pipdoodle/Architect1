Hi! This is my 112 project and since I was too lazy to provide instrucions, use WASD to move, enter to interact with things,esc to escape modes.
To play this game this requires the libraries pygame and pyaudio to be installed. Simply download the files from the website and then use python -m pip install pygame and python -m pip install pyaudio.
For the best experience please use headphones. 
Essentially, this is a simple rpg game where you take orders behind the counter and then make those however you wish inside the build mode. 
On an important note, citations. 
The general way to readFile and writeFile was taken from the CMU 112 website:http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/syllabus.html. Specifically, the code can be found in the schedule under strings.
The outline for the pygame structure as well as GameObject class came from the 112 pygame guide: https://qwewy.gitbooks.io/pygame-module-manual/content/chapter1/framework.html.
The majority of the pyaudio code came from the 112 pyaudio guide: https://abhgog.gitbooks.io/pyaudio-manual/content/sample-project.html, as well as documentation from the pyaudio website https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/docs/#example-callback-mode-audio-i-o 
Pyaudio code also came from:  https://github.com/aubio/aubio/blob/master/python/demos/demo_pitch.py, and https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/.
Finally, for the 3D graphics, I generally followed the following two tutorials: http://petercollingridge.appspot.com/3D-tutorial,https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/lets-build-a-3d-graphics-engine-points-vectors-and-basic-concepts--gamedev-8143
Lastly, credit goes to Amy Huo for writing my music as well as Katie Liu for doing some of my graphics (all parts that look nice creds goes to her)
