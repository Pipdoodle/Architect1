Hello! You can call me Dr. I.M.
Sadly, I don't have time to talk today, although you are free to stop by my office anytime!
I heard you will build houses for relative cheap prices? I need a new house located anywhere in the village. 
I would like a fireplace, some chocolate; m&ms preferably but I suppose any kind would do.
Just no raisins, if you add raisins... anyway, and some candy as well. 
Thank you very much, and welcome to the village. It was a pleasure meeting you.

Hey! If you need supplies, at 12 I'll be able to sell you supplies. Talk to me at 12 oclock. 
Did you ever wonder about the potential of immortality?
I'll tell you a secret, I am immortal.
I mean I've outlived millions of clams; therefore I am immortal. 
Random:
Hello! I'm Mammal
Excuse me, I have things to be doing.
Would you like to engage in a debate? Otherwise I must be on my way.
